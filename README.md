# ClassBuilder
A single program that when ran, will ask for input, then create a file full of the desired class names, set and get functions, and member variables. Reduces time over all coding. 

try printing this pseudocode for a demonstration  
```Person int age string name vector<int> list fstream fFile ifstream iFile ofstream oFile char middleInitial .```
